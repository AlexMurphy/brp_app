  Form submitted: Report a lost or stolen BRP

  Dear {{fullname}}

  You should hear from us in the next working day, where we will tell you what to do.

  As you are outside the UK you may need to apply for a temporary ‘replacement BRP visa’ which you can use to get back to the UK

  You must apply online for a replacement BRP visa (https://www.gov.uk/apply-uk-visa) in most countries.

  You will need to apply for a replacement BRP within 1 month of being back in the UK.

  Here is the information you have sent us:
